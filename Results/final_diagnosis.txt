### Final Diagnosis:

As a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, we have reviewed Mr. Michael Johnson's medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist. Based on the comprehensive assessments, we identify the following three possible health issues:

*   **Panic Disorder:** This is consistently identified as the primary health issue across all three reports. The patient's presentation of sudden, intense, recurrent episodes characterized by chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and an overwhelming feeling of impending doom, coupled with extensive negative cardiac and pulmonary workups that rule out physical etiologies, strongly supports this diagnosis. The Psychologist explicitly diagnoses Panic Disorder, and both the Cardiologist and Pulmonologist concur that the symptoms align with panic attacks or severe anxiety attacks.

*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** This is a pre-existing condition for Mr. Johnson, confirmed by the Psychologist's report which states, "Michael's existing diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and a family history of GAD underscore his predisposition to anxiety spectrum conditions." The Pulmonologist also references his "established history of generalized anxiety disorder," indicating it's an ongoing, underlying health issue contributing to his overall anxiety profile.

*   **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** Although not the primary cause of his acute, severe episodic symptoms, GERD is mentioned in both the Cardiologist's and Pulmonologist's reports as a known health issue for Mr. Johnson. The Cardiologist advises him to "Continue managing your GERD," signifying it is an active condition requiring ongoing attention, and the Pulmonologist notes his "history of GERD," acknowledging its presence as a co-morbid condition.
