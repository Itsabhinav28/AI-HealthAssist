# 🧠 AI Health Assist – Agentic AI for Multidisciplinary Medical Diagnostics

<img width="900" alt="AI Health Assist Demo" src="img/schema.jpg">

An agentic AI-powered system designed to simulate a multidisciplinary team of medical specialists. This Python project leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o to create domain-specific AI agents—each offering expert-level assessments and personalized treatment suggestions. The collaborative intelligence of these agents demonstrates how AI can augment clinical decision-making across cardiology, psychology, and pulmonology.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In the current version, three autonomous AI agents operate in parallel using Python threading to analyze a shared medical report. Each agent specializes in a distinct field of medicine and contributes a unique perspective. Their outputs are then synthesized by a central LLM-based summarizer, which consolidates insights and highlights **three potential health issues** relevant to the patient.

## 🧩 Active AI Agents

### 🫀 Cardiologist Agent

* **Objective**: Evaluate cardiac health and detect conditions like arrhythmias or structural abnormalities that might be overlooked in initial testing.
* **Capabilities**: Recommends ECG, Holter monitoring, or imaging tests. Provides insights on heart-focused treatment strategies.

### 🧘 Psychologist Agent

* **Objective**: Identify psychological contributors such as anxiety, panic disorders, or stress-induced symptoms.
* **Capabilities**: Suggests therapy methods, mindfulness practices, medication options, and behavioral strategies.

### 🌬️ Pulmonologist Agent

* **Objective**: Examine respiratory factors such as asthma, hyperventilation, or other pulmonary conditions mimicking cardiac symptoms.
* **Capabilities**: Advises on spirometry, bronchial challenge testing, and provides guidance on breathing exercises or inhalers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Agentic Workflow

* **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o
* **Methodology**: Concurrent agent execution with `threading`
* **Agent Architecture**: Role-specific prompt engineering
* **Final Summarizer**: Aggregates and deduplicates agent findings
* **Data Handling**: Structured synthetic medical reports

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

* **Expand Agent Pool**: Add specialists in neurology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, dermatology, and more.
* **Integration with OpenAI Assistant API**: Utilize `function calling` and `code interpreter` for dynamic report parsing and tool execution.
* **Advanced Medical Report Parsing**: Introduce semantic chunking and multimodal inputs (e.g., PDFs, lab charts, x-rays via OCR/Vision models).
* **Patient Interaction**: Enable patient-side conversational interface for query resolution, appointment routing, and next-step planning.
